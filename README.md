Make exported json archive useful

When you export your data from Facebook there is not a lot that you can do with it.

My eventual goal is to make a importer to put the data into mariadb in a format that is compatible with Nextcloud social or Wordpress

Right now I am just stumbling my way through parsing the json archive, it has been about 10 years since I wrote php so this is a mess.

Currently You can put the display.php on your webserver, and extract the facebook-youruserid.zip in the same folder and see something.

I am sure a programmer by profession that works with json on a daily basis could do this much better, but I couldn't find anything out there.
